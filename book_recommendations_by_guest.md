- Books: None parsed from lightning round
  - Raw mention: I think I always classically recommend the gospels because there's just so much love and groundbreaking thinking there. And then for people who do wind up taking an interest in story, I think one of the best books, if you want to pick that up, is Chris Vogler's, The Writer's Journey, where he took Joseph Campbell's Hero's Journey, made it 12 Steps, and he was a Disney story analyst. So, it's just really classic body of work that had really helped people get their minds around story and the archetypes.
