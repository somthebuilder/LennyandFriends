Lenny (00:00:00): Emily, you've built some incredible teams. What's your philosophy on leadership?

Emily Watson (00:00:05): Hi Lenny! I think great leadership starts with trust. You need to trust your team, and they need to trust you.

Lenny (00:00:15): How do you build that trust?

Emily Watson (00:00:20): Transparency is huge. I share context about why decisions are made, what challenges we're facing, and where we're headed. I also make sure to give credit where it's due and take responsibility when things go wrong. And I try to be consistent - people need to know what to expect from you.

Lenny (00:00:50): What about hiring? How do you identify great people?

Emily Watson (00:00:55): I look for three things: competence, character, and culture fit. Competence is obvious - can they do the job? Character matters because I want people who will do the right thing even when no one is watching. And culture fit doesn't mean everyone thinks the same - it means they share our values and can work well with the team.

Lenny (00:01:30): How do you handle difficult situations or conflicts?

Emily Watson (00:01:35): I address them head-on, but with empathy. I try to understand all perspectives before making a decision. Sometimes that means having difficult conversations, but avoiding them usually makes things worse. I also try to focus on the problem, not the person, and work together to find a solution.
