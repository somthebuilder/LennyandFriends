Lenny (00:00:00): Michael, welcome! You've helped scale several SaaS companies. What's your secret?

Michael Rodriguez (00:00:05): Thanks Lenny! I think the biggest mistake I see is companies trying to grow too fast without a solid foundation.

Lenny (00:00:15): What do you mean by foundation?

Michael Rodriguez (00:00:20): Product-market fit, first of all. You need to have a product that people actually want and are willing to pay for. Then you need systems in place - good onboarding, customer support, retention strategies. Too many companies focus on acquisition before they've figured out retention.

Lenny (00:00:45): So what's your approach to growth?

Michael Rodriguez (00:00:50): I focus on three pillars: acquisition, activation, and retention. For acquisition, I like to start with content marketing and SEO. It's slower but more sustainable than paid ads. For activation, we make sure new users see value within their first session. And for retention, we have automated email sequences, in-app messaging, and regular check-ins with customers.

Lenny (00:01:30): What about pricing? How do you think about pricing strategy?

Michael Rodriguez (00:01:35): Pricing is critical. I've seen companies leave millions on the table because they priced too low. The key is understanding the value you provide. If you're saving a customer 10 hours a week, that's worth a lot. Don't be afraid to charge what you're worth. But also, make sure you have a clear upgrade path. Start with a low entry point, then show the value of premium features.
