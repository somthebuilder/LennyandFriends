Lenny (00:00:00): Welcome to the podcast, Sarah! Thanks for joining us.

Sarah Chen (00:00:05): Thanks for having me, Lenny!

Lenny (00:00:10): So, let's start with the basics. How do you approach building a great product?

Sarah Chen (00:00:15): Well, I think the key is really understanding your users. You need to spend time with them, understand their pain points, and build something that truly solves their problems. Too many product managers jump straight into building features without really understanding what users actually need.

Lenny (00:00:45): That makes sense. Can you give us an example?

Sarah Chen (00:00:50): Sure! When I was at my previous company, we were building a dashboard feature. Instead of just building what we thought users wanted, we spent two weeks talking to 20 different users. We discovered that what they really needed wasn't more charts, but better ways to export and share data. So we pivoted and built export functionality first, and it was a huge hit.

Lenny (00:01:20): That's a great example. What about prioritization? How do you decide what to build next?

Sarah Chen (00:01:25): I use a framework I call "Impact vs Effort". For each potential feature, I score it on impact to users and effort to build. High impact, low effort features are obvious wins. But I also look at strategic alignment - does this move us toward our long-term vision? Sometimes you need to invest in high effort features that are strategically important.

Lenny (00:02:00): How do you measure success?

Sarah Chen (00:02:05): I look at a combination of metrics. User engagement is key - are people actually using the feature? But also business metrics like retention and revenue. The most important thing is to set clear success criteria before you start building, so you know what you're optimizing for.
