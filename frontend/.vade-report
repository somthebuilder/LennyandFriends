# Vercel Web Analytics Implementation

## Summary
Successfully installed and configured Vercel Web Analytics for this Next.js App Router project.

## Changes Made

### 1. Package Installation
- Installed `@vercel/analytics@^1.6.1` using npm
- Updated `package.json` and `package-lock.json` to include the new dependency

### 2. Code Integration
Modified `app/layout.tsx`:
- Added import statement: `import { Analytics } from '@vercel/analytics/next'`
- Added `<Analytics />` component inside the `<body>` tag, placed after existing components
- Maintained existing code structure and formatting

## Implementation Details

The Analytics component was added to the root layout file (`app/layout.tsx`) which is the correct location for App Router projects. The component is placed at the end of the body tag, after the `{children}` and `<BuyMeACoffeeFloater />` components, ensuring it loads after the main content.

## Verification

1. ✅ TypeScript compilation passes with no errors (`tsc --noEmit`)
2. ✅ Package successfully installed and listed in dependencies
3. ✅ Code changes follow Next.js best practices for App Router
4. ⚠️ Build encounters pre-existing error related to missing Supabase environment variables (not related to Analytics changes)
5. ⚠️ ESLint not yet configured in the project (pre-existing condition)

## Files Modified
- `app/layout.tsx` - Added Analytics import and component
- `package.json` - Added @vercel/analytics dependency
- `package-lock.json` - Updated with new package dependencies

## Notes
- The Analytics component will automatically track page views and Web Vitals when deployed to Vercel
- No additional configuration is required for basic analytics functionality
- The build error encountered is a pre-existing issue related to missing Supabase environment variables, not related to the Analytics implementation
